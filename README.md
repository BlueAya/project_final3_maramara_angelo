## Resources
- [Google Images](https://images.google.com/)
	- I used Google Images for a lot of the stock photos on my site and background image
- [HTML5 Outliner](https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/)
	- I used this outliner tool to assist me in creating semantically sound code

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
	- I used this tool to validate my code and make sure there were no errors
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
	- I used Font Awesome for a few of the icons found on my Contact page

## jQuery Plugins
- [SlickNav](https://github.com/ComputerWolf/SlickNav)
	- This jQuery plugin helps to quickly create a mobile friendly hamburger menu that expands to reveal the site's navigation. You can find this plugin being used on each page of my site on smaller screens.
- [bxSlider](https://github.com/stevenwanderski/bxslider-4)
	- This jQuery plugin creates a quick and responsive slider that you can easily place images in and control the rate in which it transitions from one slide to the next. You can find this plugin being used on the Home page of my site.
- [Akordeon](https://github.com/mshahbazsaleem/Akordeon)
	- This jQuery plugin creates a collapsible menu that  can be broken up into sub categories. I used this plugin on my Menu page to categorize each menu item.

## Custom JaveScript and jQuery
- The custom JavaScript that I implemented can be found on the Home page of my site. This code listens for when the user clicks on the Toy Story alien image. After clicking on the image, this code adds the text including a promo code for a free game, right above the Awards heading. This code also adds styling to the text to make it stand out when added to the page. I needed to wrap the Event Listener in an if statement to prevent errors from appearing in the other pages where the page could not find the element with the id of "alien".
- The custom jQuery that I implemented can be found throughout each page of my site. It takes all of the paragraph elements and sets them to hidden which is then followed by a fade in, which fades them onto the page as it loads.

## Comments
- When working with multi-page sites, is it best practice to link each page with the same plugins and scripts, even if that specific page doesn't use it? Or is it better to have more .js files instead of consolidating everything into one main .js file? I was just curious what your thoughts were in this situation.
- Thank you so much for a great semester Richard. I really learned a lot, and when I say that, I feel like that is such an understatement. I've been eagerly waiting this whole program to learn responsive design and become more comfortable with JavaScript. I know there is plenty more to learn ahead, but I feel that much closer to my goal. Thank you again.
